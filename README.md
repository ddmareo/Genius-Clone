# Genius-Clone

Genius-Clone is an online music encyclopedia inspired by Genius, designed for diehard music enthusiasts, featuring verified lyrics from artists for accuracy. It utilizes AI to help users explore the themes, emotions, and contexts of songs, providing deeper insights into their meaning. Additionally, it includes a music chart system that allows users to sort songs by rating, popularity, or release date, keeping them updated on current music trends. Built as a fast and optimized React application with Vite and pnpm for efficient dependency management, Genius-Clone also integrates Firebase for backend services, including authentication, real-time databases, and hosting.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine. This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager, so you will need to install pnpm globally if you havenâ€™t already.

### Install `pnpm` globally:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the project up and running locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ddmareo/genius-clone.git
cd genius-clone
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server
```bash
pnpm run dev

This will launch the Vite development server. You can now access the application at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if specified).
