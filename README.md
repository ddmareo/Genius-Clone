# Genius-Clone

Genius-Clone is a website designed to imitate the famous song lyric platform Genius. However, in Genius-Clone, there is no collaborative analysis feature like the original does. That being said, Genius-Clone is basically an online music encyclopedia made for diehard music enthusiasts worldwide.

Not only that, what makes Genius-Clone different from other song lyric websites is that the lyrics of every song listed in the platform are verified by the artists themselves, eliminating the worry about the accuracy and credibility of the lyrics.

In addition to the original Genius features, Genius-Clone uses the help of AI to help users understand themes, emotions, and contexts in songs, providing a deeper insight to the meaning of the song.

Moreover, Genius-Clone provides a music chart or ranking system in which users can choose to sort the chart based on rating, popularity, and release date, either in ascending or descending order. This way, users can instantly get a grasp at the current trends in music.
