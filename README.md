# Genius-Clone

Genius-Clone is an online music encyclopedia inspired by Genius, designed for diehard music enthusiasts, featuring verified lyrics from artists for accuracy. It utilizes AI to help users explore the themes, emotions, and contexts of songs, providing deeper insights into their meaning. Additionally, it includes a music chart system that allows users to sort songs by rating, popularity, or release date, keeping them updated on current music trends. 

This project is a fast and optimized React application built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool, using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager for efficient and reliable dependency management. Additionally, this project integrates [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for backend services, providing features like authentication, real-time databases, and hosting. It also uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, enabling a responsive and customizable design.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine. This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager, so you will need to install pnpm globally if you havenâ€™t already.

### Install `pnpm` globally:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the project up and running locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ddmareo/genius-clone.git
cd genius-clone
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will launch the Vite development server. You can now access the application at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if specified).
