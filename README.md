# Genius-Clone


Genius-Clone is an online music encyclopedia inspired by Genius, designed for diehard music enthusiasts. Unlike the original platform, Genius-Clone focuses on verified lyrics directly from artists, ensuring accuracy. It also uses AI to help users explore the themes, emotions, and contexts of songs, offering deeper insights into their meaning. Additionally, Genius-Clone features a music chart system that allows users to sort songs by rating, popularity, or release date, making it easy to stay updated on current music trends.

Genius-Clone is a fast and optimized React application built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool, using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager for efficient and reliable dependency management. Additionally, this project integrates [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for backend services, providing features like authentication, real-time databases, and hosting.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine. This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager, so you will need to install pnpm globally if you havenâ€™t already.

### Install `pnpm` globally:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the project up and running locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will launch the Vite development server. You can now access the application at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if specified).
