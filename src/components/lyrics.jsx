      Imagine if I never messed up
      Imagine if we never even broke up
      Imagine if I had the power to control the voices in my head
      And I could tell them all to shut the fuck up
      Imagine if I never told a lie
      Imagine if I knew how to always get it right
      Imagine if I wasn't such a coward
      And I had the courage hidden somewhere in my heart
      To look you in the eye, yeah, yeah  
      </h2>
